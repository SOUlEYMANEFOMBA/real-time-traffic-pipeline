# üö¶ Real-Time Traffic Pipeline

## üß† Problem Statement

Urban road congestion is a growing challenge in major cities, leading to significant time loss, increased fuel consumption, and air pollution.  
Access to **real-time traffic data** is essential for smarter decision-making, optimizing travel routes, and improving urban transport policies.

## üéØ Project Objective

This project aims to build an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** that collects, processes, stores, and visualizes traffic data using the **TomTom Traffic API**.

The pipeline will allow users to:
- Monitor real-time traffic conditions
- Identify congestion hotspots
- Generate actionable insights via a live dashboard
